## üîß The `post-call` Tool

A custom **Function Tool** in Vapi called `post-call` was created to finalize bookings.

- It is triggered **after the user confirms their name and time**
- Sends booking data (name + time) to a webhook (n8n)
- The webhook checks availability and returns a confirmation message to the user **during the same call**

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "say",
      "text": "Your appointment has been successfully booked for tomorrow at 6 PM. Looking forward to it!"
    }
  ]
}
